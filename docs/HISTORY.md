# History

Finished steps of `docs/PLAN.md`, moved word for word, newest first.

## Step 0: setup

- Step 0: setup. The project rules (`AGENTS.md`), the README, the goal (`docs/spec.md`), the format specification (`docs/format.md`, copied from Markgraf and reviewed), the plan, the license, and the stack: Bun, mise, bun:test, lefthook with a pre-push hook that runs `mise run test`. A test checks that the docs have no GFM pipe table until the lint of step 6 exists. Done on 2026-10-05. The decisions of the format review are in `docs/review-queue.md`.
